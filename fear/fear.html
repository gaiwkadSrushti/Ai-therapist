            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Fear is a natural, powerful, and primitive human emotion. It involves a universal biochemical response as well as a high individual emotional response. Fear alerts us to the presence of danger or the threat of harm, whether that danger is physical or psychological.

                Sometimes fear stems from real threats, but it can also originate from imagined dangers. Fear can also be a symptom of some mental health conditions including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                
                
                Fear is composed of two primary reactions to some type of perceived threat: biochemical and emotional.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-1xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900">Solution on Fear</h1>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">1. Count down</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Count down (or up) to 10. If you’re really mad, start at 100. In the time it takes you to count, your heart rate will slow, and your anger will likely subside.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">2. Take a breather</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Your breathing becomes shallower and speeds up as you grow angry. Reverse that trend (and your anger) by taking slow, deep breaths from your nose and exhaling out of your mouth for several moments.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">3. Go walk around</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">ExerciseTrusted Source can help calm your nerves and reduce anger. Go for a walk, ride your bike, or hit a few golf balls. Anything that gets your limbs pumping is good for your mind and body.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">4. Relax your muscles</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Progressive muscle relaxation calls on you to tense and slowly relax various muscle groups in your body, one at a time. As you tense and release, take slow, deliberate breaths.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">5. Repeat a mantra</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Find a word or phrase that helps you calm down and refocus. Repeat that word again and again to yourself when you’re upset. “Relax,” “Take it easy, and “You’ll be OK” are all good examples.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">6. Stretch</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Neck rolls and shoulder rolls are good examples of nonstrenuous yoga-like movements that can help you control your body and harness your emotions. No fancy equipment required.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">7. Mentally escape</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Slip into a quiet room, close your eyes, and practice visualizing yourself in a relaxing scene. Focus on details in the imaginary scene: What color is the water? How tall are the mountains? What do the chirping birds sound like? This practice can help you find calm amidst anger.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">8. Play some tunes</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Let music carry you away from your feelings. Put in earbuds or slip out to your car. Crank up your favorite music and hum, bop, or sashay your anger away.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">9. Stop talking</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">When you’re steamed, you may be tempted to let the angry words fly, but you’re more likely to do harm than good. Pretend your lips are glued shut, just like you did as a kid. This moment without speaking will give you time to collect your thoughts.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">10. Take a timeout</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Give yourself a break. Sit away from others. In this quiet time, you can process events and return your emotions to neutral. You may even find this time away from others is so helpful you want to schedule it into your daily routine.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"></p>. Take action</h1>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Harness your angry energy. Sign a petition. Write a note to an official. Do something good for someone else. Pour your energy and emotions into something that’s healthy and productive.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">12. Write in your journal</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">What you can’t say, perhaps you can write. Jot down what you’re feeling and how you want to respond. Processing it through the written word can help you calm down and reassess the events leading up to your feelings.</p>
