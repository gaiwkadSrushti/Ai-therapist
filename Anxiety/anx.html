            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Anxiety is a normal emotion. It’s your brain’s way of reacting to stress and alerting you of potential danger ahead.

                Everyone feels anxious now and then. For example, you may worry when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision.
                
                
                Occasional anxiety is OK. But anxiety disorders are different. They’re a group of mental illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear.  The excessive anxiety can make you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or worsen your symptoms.
                
                With treatment, many people with anxiety disorders can manage their feelings.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-1xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900">Solution on Anxiety</h1>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">1. Stay active:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Regular exercise is good for your physical and emotional health. Regular exercise works as well as medication to ease anxiety for some people. And it’s not just a short-term fix; you may experience anxiety relief for hours after working out.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">2. Don’t drink alcohol:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Alcohol is a natural sedative. Drinking a glass of wine or a finger of whiskey when your nerves are shot may calm you at first. Once the buzz is over, however, anxiety may return with a vengeance. If you rely on alcohol to relieve anxiety instead of treating the root of the problem, you may develop alcohol dependence.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">3. Stop smoking:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Smokers often reach for a cigarette during stressful times. Yet, like drinking alcohol, taking a drag on a cigarette when you’re stressed is a quick fix that may worsen anxiety over time. ResearchTrusted Source has shown that the earlier you start smoking in life, the higher your risk of developing an anxiety disorder later. Research also suggests nicotine and other chemicals in cigarette smoke alter pathways in the brain linked to anxiety.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">4. Ditch caffeine:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              If you have chronic anxiety, caffeine is not your friend. Caffeine may cause nervousness and jitters, neither of which is good if you’re anxious. Research has shown caffeine may cause or worsen anxiety disorders. It may also cause panic attacks in people with panic disorder. In some people, eliminating caffeine may significantly improve anxiety symptoms.</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">5. Get some sleep:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Insomnia is a common symptom of anxiety. Make sleep a priority by:
              
              only sleeping at night when you’re tired
              not reading or watching television in bed
              not using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed
              not tossing and turning in your bed if you can’t
              sleep; get up and go to another room until you feel sleepy
              avoiding caffeine, large meals, and nicotine
              before bedtime
              keeping your room dark and cool
              writing down your worries before going to bed
              going to sleep at the same time each night</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">6. Meditate:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              A main goal of meditation is to remove chaotic thoughts from your mind and replace them with a sense of calm and mindfulness of the present moment. Meditation is known for relieving stress and anxiety. Research from John Hopkins suggests 30 minutes of daily meditation may alleviate some anxiety symptoms and act as an antidepressant.

            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">7. Eat a healthy diet:</p>
            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
              Low blood sugar levels, dehydration, or chemicals in processed foods such as artificial flavorings, artificial colorings, and preservatives may cause mood changes in some people. A high-sugar diet may also impact temperament. If your anxiety worsens after eating, check your eating habits. Stay hydrated, eliminate processed foods, and eat a healthy diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.</p>
